# Roadmap

## Static files handling

* node, grunt or gulp for static file handling - lets discuss

## Install django-rest-framework

* We need a separated backend + frontend
* We need an API for Signup, Signin user type A, signin user type B, Passwort change and passwort recovery

## Registration + Passwort forget

* Either django-allauth or django-registration(-redux), await instructions please, maybe we do not need it because of the APis

## React + HTML5 Boilerplate + Bootstrap 4.0

* Fully seperated and a new Django App
* Install React as a seperated app with no models and views
* It should communicate with the API (Signin, Signup, Passwort forget, etc.)
* Check HTML5 Boilerplate Webpage (if needed with Redux?)
* Setup Django Flatpages for the setup of pages in the Admin (checkout modern webpages)
* Static pages: Startpage, Imprint 
* Integration from a cool template we buy or make

## A nice form integration

* django-crispy-forms? Something from React, just using a form API?
* Renders API posts as forms or rather vice versa - can send beautiful forms to an API and prints errors very good.
* Is being able to have form wizards

## Setup Jenkins

* Setup a Jenkins Docker container on Digital ocean
* Integrate Jenkins
* Write API tests for the django-rest-framework APIs

# For later
